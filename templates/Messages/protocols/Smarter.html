    <ul>
  <li>Perform a iterative trimming of the 5' end of the read by means of iteratively aligning the reads to the genome sequence trimming unmapped reads by 1 nt (4 rounds of trimming).   </li>
  <li>Detect the adapter sequence: AAAAAAAAAAAA </li>
  <li>Minimum length of adapter sequence that needs to be aligned: 10 </li>
  <li>Allowed mismatches between adapter and reference sequences: 1 </li>

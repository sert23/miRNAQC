These features are provided as absolute values and ranked with a percentile calculated from a corpus of more than 36,000 samples. Availability To use mirnaQC webserver visit arn.ugr.es/mirnaqc/ Quick Start mirnaQC is quite intuitive so we recommend to go ahead and try to explore the tool by yourself. Here we provide a basic description of the analysis available. Input data You can see an interactive tutorial here mirnaQC will calculate quality control parameters for each of the miRNA-seq samples provided. Several input formats are supported and they can all be combined: Reads files can be directly uploaded to the page (fastq, fastq.gz). Links to files can be pasted. More than one can be provided if they are comma-separated. SRA run accessions (they start with SRR, ERR or DRR e.g. SRR1563062) can be pasted. More than one can be provided if they are comma-separated. zip files zipped files (.zip, .7z, .tar.gz or .tgz) containing one or several samples can also be uploaded. They need to have the correct extension (.zip, .7z, .tar.gz or .tgz). Zip files (need to have extension 'zip' like reads.zip), gzipped tar files (extension tar.gz or' tgz' like reads.tar.gz or reads.tgz) or 7z files (extension '7z' like reads.7z). Please note that we recommend uploading your files to a server and providing links. This will help jobs run faster and files can be reused. Technical details should also be provided (if available) to ensure your samples are profiled correctly. If these are not provided mirnaQC will try to guess them. Queue system To ensure our servers do not collapse, jobs are run sequentially. Once a job has been correctly placed in queue, a view will be displayed to inform of job progress. Once a job starts running, it should take approximately 5 minutes per sample. Of course this can vary depending on input size. Results page You can see an interactive tutorial here Report sections Sequencing yield This section focuses on the amount of reads and the fraction that can be assigned to known miRNAs. Generally parameters in this category (percentage of valid reads, detected microRNAs) indicate high quality when they hold high values. Low numbers (especially for the percentage of valid input reads) can be related to problems in most aspects of RNA processing or low input. Some sources like exosomes extracted from bodily fluids however, are known to hold low levels of miRNA, thus high numbers should not be expected for all sample types even for high quality libraries. Library quality In this category we list the number of reads that are filtered out due to minimal length (15nt), the percentage of ribosomal RNA and the percentage of short reads (15-17 nt) which might be degradation products from longer RNA molecules as no small RNAs are known in this length range. High percentages of adapter-dimers (0, 1 or 2nt fragments after trimming) normally indicate issues with the ratio of adapter to input RNA concentration. In practice, it is very difficult to completely avoid adapter-dimers, especially in low input samples such as blood, but the percentile may show a reasonable potential of improvement. Ultra-short reads are defined as fragments with lengths between 3nt and 14nt (both inclusive). Library complexity In general it is also interesting to assess the complexity of the sample since low complexity libraries provide very little information, even for a high quality sequencing, which is not desired. Several measurements are provided to grasp the complexity at two levels that should be interpreted together: Sequencing library complexity: This is simply estimated by the total number of reads to unique reads ratio. Lower numbers suggest higher RNA diversity but it can also be caused by degradation. microRNA complexity: Frequently few microRNAs accumulate virtually all miRNA reads preventing lowly expressed miRNAs from being detected. Several measures are given to estimate complexity at this level: i) percentage of miRNA reads taken by the first 5 and first 20 miRNAs, ii) the number of miRNAs required to reach 50%, 75% and 95% of the miRNA expression. Putative contamination Percentage of reads that could not be mapped to the species genome are calculated. Contamination is subsequently estimated by mapping against a collection of bacterial and viral genomes. Read length distribution A narrow peak around 22 nucleotides in the read length distribution indicates good quality samples whereas degraded or poor RNA quality manifests in a broader distribution. Furthermore, it is clear that the 22nt peak should be present for miRNA assigned reads and RNA quality issues might exist if samples deviate from this. We summarise the miRNA read length distribution in several ways: mean length, mode of the distribution, the fraction of reads with lengths 21, 22 or 23, the standard deviation and the skewness of the distribution. RNA composition The relative abundance of other RNA molecules is automatically profiled using the sRNAtoolbox database (9). Most of these longer RNA species (rRNA,mRNA, lincRNA) are not known to be processed into smaller molecules that can be picked up by miRNA-seq. Their presence is a symptom of degradation since smaller fragments are randomly generated and then sequenced. Among these, rRNA is typically used because it\u2019s the most abundant one. Sequencing quality Sequencing quality is determined by means of FastQC program. We determine the mean values of the different percentiles provided by fastqc over all positions of the read.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"#welcome-to-mirnaqc-documentation-page","text":"mirnaQC is a webserver dedicated to miRNA-seq Quality Control. mirnaQC provides several quality features that can help researchers identify issues in their samples.

A: For some attributes, low values are good (adapter dimers or percentage of ribosomal RNA fragments) while for others higher numbers are better (microRNA yield, percentage of reads in the analysis, Phred Scores). For each attribute and sample we provide the percentile the value has in the background distribution (the reference corpus). Therefore, for adapter-dimers, lower quartile values are good, while for microRNA yield upper quartile values would be desired. However, in order to keep the color code coherent the \u2018good quartile\u2019 will always be displayed in green while \u2018the bad quartile\u2019 will appear in red. Q: How is the heatmap generated? A: In order to generate a unique colour scheme in the heatmap, the percentiles need to be transformed so that the lower quartile indicates good performance while the upper quartile indicates bad results (see also What are the good percentiles? above for more information). Q: Is SOLID data supported? A: mirnaQC was conceptually designed for Illumina (nucleotide space) data. That implies that the pipeline can process SOLID data but many attributes will be meaningless. This is because to analyse SOLID data, colour space reads are mapped to the genome first in order to perform the conversion to nucleotide space. This means that the percentage of mapped reads or even adapter dimers cannot be assessed. Other attributes like the number of miRNAs, percentage of short reads, library complexity can be correctly analysed and compared.","title":"FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)"},{"location":"FAQs/#faqs-frquently-asked-questions","text":"Q: Which percentiles indicate good quality?

Included quality attributes cover a broad range of aspects such as sequencing and microRNA yield, estimation of RNA degradation through rRNA and mRNA fragments or library preparation. To improve their interpretability, quality attributes are ranked using a reference distribution generated with over 36,000 publicly available miRNA-seq datasets. Accepted input formats include FASTQ and SRA accessions (link to the corresponding section). mirnaQC can be useful in at least 3 different ways: i) external quality assessment of the provided amples ii) detection of specific quality issues, which might be especially relevant for pilot studies that aim to optimize the protocol prior to run a high number of samples and iii) detection of samples that might bias downstream results and therefore should be eliminated or treated separately. One of the future goals will be to relate the provided quality features better with both, upstream (sample preparation) and downstream (differential expression, functional analysis) decisions which will allow to provide more exact automated recommendations.

To explain this, let's consider the percentage of reads assigned to known microRNAs and the number of detected microRNAs. Very often the focus of small RNA-seq experiments is on microRNAs so high values of parameters related to miRNAs abundance should indicate high quality.

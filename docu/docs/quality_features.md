#Quality features



##Sequencing yield

**<u>Raw number of reads</u>** (Raw reads): Total number of raw input reads, i.e. before adapter trimming and filtering.
Generally, samples should be at least 1M reads, especially considering RPM (Reads per Million) is the most common normalisation method. Samples below 500k reads are not acceptable. Because reads can be dropped from the analysis after trimming and filtering, more attention should be paid to **Number of reads in analysis** and **Percentage of reads in analysis**.
